				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<!-- <p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p> -->
				<p>
					Relation to inspring image:
					<br><br>
					
					- Color: The sky, grass, tree, fern, and mountain colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the Photoshop eyedropper tool. 
					The snow pile on the mountain as well as the snowflakes were just a pure white color.
					<br><br>
					- Primitives: The trees are rendered with `triangle` primitives. The snowflakes were created using the ellipse function.
					<br><br>
					- Polygons: The background mountain is a single randomly polygon using `vertex` calls.
					The snow pile was created using both the beginShapre and endShape functions, as well as using the random function for the vertices.
					<br><br>
					- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains and differently positioned trees.
					The ferns are also random generated, as well as the shape of the snow pile and quantity of snowflakes.
					<br><br>
					- Life: The position of trees is animated over time as if to simulate the view from a passing train and the slightly responds to the horizontal motion of the mouse cursor.
					The snowflakes and fern appear in random quantities and generate over a period of time much like the trees using millis, with the ferns also using randomness to determine their color.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<!-- <p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p> -->
				<p>I found this project to be pretty interesting as generative art was something completely foreign to me.
					The project's restrictions made it pretty interesting to try and work around and I think it was a good
					learning experience as a result.

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<!-- <p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p> -->
				<p>
					This project was inspired off the meme trend that was popular back in the late 2010's where various news articles would display headlines featuring 
					a template along the lines of, "Florida Man (inserts crazy headline)". 
					<br>
					<br>
					Example of a Florida Man article:
					https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/drunk-florida-man-crashes-lawn-mower-police-car/

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<!-- <p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p> -->
				<p>
					The way this program works is that it takes a random key in an array and displays it accordingly to where the
					array is called in the code. (recognized through the $ sign)
					<br>
					<br>
					This process is done through the roll button that randomly chooses a word in a set of arrays
					and displays it in different parts of the template where the words are called.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<!-- <p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p> -->
				<p>This is my first time in a while using Javascript, HTML and CSS, so it will take some time to relearn everything
				   and get used to how these langauges work again. I also want to understand more on how Glitch.com works.

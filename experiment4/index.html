				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> This project was based on 3 different images. An image of space, a flower garden, and an open water landscape. 
					The first world is based off a water landscape and contains different bodies of water and different types of rocks. 
					The second world is a flower garden that is full of wildlife and has a rain mechanic. 
					The last world is an open field that encapsulates the black vacuum of space and has planets and stars that shine.
					<br>
					<br>
					For 2 of the worlds (flower garden and ravine), I used a tilesheet provided by Professor Mode.
					The author of this pack is called "scrabling" and his work is linked below.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> 
				- Ravine is made using different rock and water tiles. Water is animated and has a chance of seagulls spawning.
				<br>
				- Flower garden is made using different wildlife tiles, rocks and water. Some animated rain is added to match the original
				image more.
				<br>
				- Space is made using differnt PNGs of different planets (Earth, Saturn, Jupiter) and some stars; all over a black
				background that simulates the vaccum of space. Stars are also animated to illuminate.
				<br>
				- Extra Credit: all 3 worlds are visible and interactable on one screen.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This experiment wasn't as difficult as the previous one and it was a lot more fun, but challenging nevertheless.
					Although it was difficult, I felt proud of managing to generate three sets of worlds (ravine, flower garden, space).
					I took my time with experimenting with the different tiles that were featured in the texture pack and 
					eventually came to a design that I really liked. I'm particularly prouds of the ravine as it looks great 
					with its water themed design. I thought the animated water and birds really added some charm to the design.
					The hardest part was definitely the garden. It was difficult to make different bodies of water
					and different intensities in the rain.

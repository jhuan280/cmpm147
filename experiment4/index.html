				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project was based on a winter landscape. The winter landscape was essentially snow resting on grass and dirt, 
				   while also being surrounded by trees and having shadows casted on the snow. Switch between worlds with the switch button.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> 
				- Overworld generates different seeds that consist of dirt, snow, trees, houses and animated water/clouds
				<br>
				- Dungeon generates different seeds that consist of different textured walls and treasure chests
				<br>
				- Clicking the reseed button will generate a random tileset based off a texture pack
				<br>
				- Clicking the switch button will switch from the overworld to the dungeon and vice versa
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This experiment was pretty difficult and was by far the hardest assignment we've done so far.
					Although it was difficult, I felt proud of managing to generate two sets of worlds (overworld + dungeon)
					I took my time with experimenting with the different tiles that were featured in the texture pack and 
					eventually came to a design that I really liked. I'm particularly prouds of the overworld as it looks great 
					with its winter themed design. I thought the animated water and clouds really added some charm to the design.
					The hardest part was definitely the dungeon. It was really difficult making different rooms and connecting them.

				This project was essentially just an image renderer. Using a dropdown box, the user can select a picture of one
				of many different browser logos and icons and has the program draw out the icons using primitive shapes and 
				colors that correspond to said picture.
				<br>
				<br>
				Some of these images include browser logos like Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge amongst many more.
				</p>

                <p>
					Images are read and generate using primitive shapes such as rectangles, squares, triangles and circles.
					These shapes use a sense of randomness and each generated iteration has a varied amount of these shapes.
					The colors of these shapes also correspond with their respective icons.
                </p>
            </div>

                    This experiment wasn't as difficult as the previous one, but challenging nevertheless. 
                    I felt proud of managing to generate different sorts sets of icons (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc).
                    I took my time with messing around with the different shapes and colors that were being displayed to represent
                    each image and eventually came to a design that I liked.
